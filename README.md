## **Using Chainlink to help sustainable energy projects flourish on-chain and establishing a link between energy communities and crowdlending to finance projects.** 

## Inspiration
The inspiration for EcoVerse emerged from the growing need to address climate change at a hyperlocal level and the desire to empower local communities in managing their energy resources.

**The Problem**
Sustainable energy growth faces hurdles:

1. Governance: creating a community with trusted parties. 

2. Financing: access to the right capital and funders want an easier way to find & invest in projects. 

3. Operational support: energy trading and connections to the stakeholders.  

With EcoVerse, anyone anywhere can transform their renewable energy resources into a vested community of energy sharing stakeholders.

Imagine if you could be part of a renewable energy community and contribute and earn from it while having both financial gains and  a cleaner climate as the upside. 

## What it does
**Our Solution**
A dApp that allows users to:
1. Create an energy community with DAO governance
2. Raise financing through a crowd lending campaign
3. Local energy trading and a dashboard to track your renewable energy positive impact

EcoVerse is a DAO based platform designed to facilitate the management of energy communities.  The project creates a platform to enable individuals to build and join "energy communities" (group of people who can pool energy & resources) with DAO governance, create campaigns to raise funds for sustainable energy projects, and invest in sustainable energy and climate protection projects. The platform is designed to facilitate energy community creation and crowdlending, which allows multiple investors to pool their money together to fund a project. 

We are leveraging Chainlink Functions to:
1. Fetch consumption and production data for your community members from the energy distributor.
2. Gather energy prices from the electricity market, presently inclusive of the Iberian Market—Portugal and Spain.
3. Fetch energy tariffs from the regulator, currently only in Portugal.
4. Execute an algorithm that calculates the equilibrium price and the transactions within your community every hour.

## How we built it

Tech stack:
Next.js, React, Redux, Tailwind, 
EVM-compatible smart contracts written in Solidity provides business logic and trust for the platform
IPFS to store images of energy community membership NFTs


Smart contract functionalities
The smart contracts used in EcoVerse provide the following:

Create new Campaigns: Users can use the platform to create new funding campaigns for their sustainable projects
Pledge/Unpledge tokens: Investors can pledge or unpledged tokens to the campaigns they want to support
Claim funds: Creators can claim the funds they have raised to invest in their sustainable projects
Claim pledged tokens with an APY: Users can claim the pledged tokens they have contributed to a campaign with an Annual Percentage Yield(APY) provided by the campaign

## Challenges we ran into

We took up the challenge of aggregating the data from various sources and incorporating Chainlink Functions to build the most informative level of dashboard info for our users. Our solution works to bridge Web3 with Web2 and we found the process was very helpful using Chainlink.
We will work on solving the local electric regulatory issues with further reach into the markets and we find that certain markets are more open to energy communities formation.  We see our project development in creating a hybrid of an dApp and a educational resource to help bring the communities of stakeholders onboard with this streamlined way of energy communities. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We excited about finishing our dApp for the hackathon and building a well-coordinated team with clear vision for developing the project. We’ve managed to allow the creation of an energy community, bring on-board community members, generate a crowd lending campaign, and build a dashboard with data coming in from multiple sources using Chainlink. 
 
## What we learned

We learned that when re-thinking existing energy communities with a blockchain based governance it fundamentally changes the game and creates new opportunities and a better alignment with the best pricing for solar users.  The Chainlink Functions feature opened up possibilities to integrate data that would make the process smooth and efficient.  The whole process makes it easier to make decisions as an energy community and as stakeholders in the community. 


## What's next for EcoVerse

With the right funding we aim to:


**1.  Release and Launch MVP on Testnet:** Our primary focus during this phase will be to ensure that the initial features and functions of the platform are running smoothly. This includes the implementation of governance protocols, financing mechanisms, and operational support for energy trading. By launching our MVP on Testnet, we can gather vital feedback and address any potential issues before deploying the platform on the mainnet. This iterative process will help us to create a reliable, robust, and user-friendly platform for our users.

**2.  Onboard First Industrial Community:** Once our platform has been thoroughly tested and refined, our next goal is to onboard our first industrial community. We will work closely with this community to facilitate the integration process and provide necessary support. Their feedback will help us to better understand user needs and improve our services. This practical application will provide us invaluable insights into the real-world utility of our platform and will give us a solid foundation for attracting more communities in the future.

**3.  Expand Platform Features and Capabilities:** Our third goal is to continue to develop and refine our platform based on the needs of our growing user base. This could include introducing additional financial instruments, creating more sophisticated governance mechanisms, or developing advanced AI capabilities to optimize energy trading. By continuously enhancing our platform, we will ensure that it remains at the cutting edge of the energy sector and that it continues to provide the best possible value to our users. We will also explore partnerships with other organizations to expand our reach and improve our platform's effectiveness.
